Task-1:# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
This Python program implements a simple Hangman game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected word from a small predefined list. The game displays the word with unguessed letters hidden as underscores and allows the player up to six incorrect guesses. It keeps track of letters already guessed and provides feedback for correct and wrong guesses. The game continues until the user either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts, at which point a victory or game-over message is displayed. This program demonstrates basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, string handling, user input, and random selection.


Task-4:#Basic Chatbot

Description:
  This Python script implements a simple text-based chatbot that interacts with the user through the terminal. The chatbot responds to basic greetings, questions     about its name, well-being, and the weather. It also provides help instructions. If the user enters something it doesn’t recognize, it politely informs them that   it cannot understand the input.

Key Features:

  1.Greeting & Farewell – Recognizes "hello", "hi", and "bye" to greet or end the chat.
  
  2.Basic Conversation – Responds to "how are you", "your name", and "weather".
  
  3.Help Functionality – Provides instructions on what the user can ask.
  
  4.Fallback Response – Handles unrecognized input gracefully.
  
  5.Continuous Interaction – Uses a while True loop to keep the conversation going until the user types "bye".

How it works:

  -->The program starts by printing a welcome message.
  
  -->It continuously takes user input, converts it to lowercase, and checks it against predefined keywords.
  
  -->Depending on the input, the bot responds with an appropriate message.
  
  -->Typing "bye" exits the chat loop with a friendly goodbye message.

Usage:
Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended). Type your messages in the terminal, and the chatbot will respond according to its programmed rules.
