This Python program implements a simple Hangman game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected word from a small predefined list. The game displays the word with unguessed letters hidden as underscores and allows the player up to six incorrect guesses. It keeps track of letters already guessed and provides feedback for correct and wrong guesses. The game continues until the user either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts, at which point a victory or game-over message is displayed. This program demonstrates basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, string handling, user input, and random selection.
